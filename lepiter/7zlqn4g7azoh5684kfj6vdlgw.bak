				"string" : "# Note on Form and diplay color\n\nA bitmap image is a raster image (containing pixel data as opposed to vector images) format. Each pixel of a bitmap image is defined by a single bit or a group of bits. Hence, it is called the bitmap or a map of bits and pixels.\n\nA Bitmap image is an uncompressed file format which means, every pixel of an image has its own bit (or group of bits) in the file.\n\nIn Pharo, a Form is a rectangular array of pixels, used for holding images.   All pictures, including character images are Forms.\n\nCreation of a Form:\n\n```smalltalk\nForm extent: extentPoint depth: bitsPerPixel fromArray: anArray offset: offsetPoint\n\nextent: the number of point composing the form.\ndepth: the color depth of the form\narray: data of the form.\noffset: Specify an offset to move the form from coordinate 0@0 when combining form.\n```\n\nThe depth of a Form is how many bits are used to specify the color at each pixel.  The supported depths (in bits) are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. The color depth is a measure of an individual image pixel to accurately represent a color. Color depth is calculated in bits-per-pixel or bpp.\n\n\n\nThe bits representing the bitmap pixels are packed in rows. The size of each row is rounded up to a multiple of 4 bytes (32 bits). The pixel array describes the image pixel by pixel. You can also have an alpha-channel to add transparency in the image using 32-bit color depth.\n\nThe coordinates of a Form start from the top-left corner much like most graphic system out there (why ? Because Western language are mostly written left to right, top to bottom, and initial text display follow this convention, instead of classic cartesian coordinate). Forms are indexed starting at 0 instead of 1; thus, the top-left pixel of a Form has coordinates 0@0.\n\nThe actual bits are held in a Bitmap, whose internal structure is different at each depth.\n"
