# Note on Form and diplay color:

A bitmap image is a raster image (containing pixel data as opposed to vector 
images) format. Each pixel of a bitmap image is defined by a single bit or a 
group of bits. Hence, it is called the bitmap or a map of bits and pixels.

A Bitmap image is an uncompressed file format which means, every pixel of an 
image has its own bit (or group of bits) in the file. 

In Pharo, a Form is a rectangular array of pixels, used for holding images.  
All pictures, including character images are Forms. 

Creation of a Form:

```smalltalk
Form extent: extentPoint depth: bitsPerPixel fromArray: anArray offset: offsetPoint 

extent: the number of point composing the form.
depth: the color depth of the form
array: data of the form.
offset: Specify an offset to move the form from coordinate 0@0 when combining form.
```

The depth of a Form is how many bits are used to specify the color at each pixel.  
The supported depths (in bits) are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. The color depth is a 
measure of an individual image pixel to accurately represent a color. Color 
depth is calculated in bits-per-pixel or bpp.



The offset of a form is the amount by which the form should be offset when it is
displayed or when its position is tested. Every form has an assumed origin at the top lefthand comer of the image. When a form is sent a message to display itself, for example,

```smalltalk
bug displayAt: 150@150
```

the form is displayed with its origin at the specified point plus the offset; i.e., 150@150. The bug is therefore displayed so that its center is located at the point ISO@IS0. The ability to specify an offset is particularly useful when defining cursors that have logical origins or "hot spots." For example, the logical origin of the crosshairs cursor is at the center of the crosshairs.

For example, 1-bit color depth or 1bpp means a pixel can have a 1-bit color or 2 
values. Monochromatic images have 1-bit color depth because a pixel can be true 
black or true white.

The number of actual colors at these depths are: 2, 4, 16, 256, 32768, and 16 million.
For different color depth, you can store a different number of pixel for each 
element compising the array of data.

|Depth   | number of color  | pixel displayed |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
|1       |2^1 = 2           | 32              |
|2       |2^2 = 4           | 16              |
|4       |2^4 = 16          | 8               |
|8       |2^8 = 256         | 4               |
|16      |2^16 = 32768      | 2               |
|32      |2^32 = 16 millions| 1               |

The bits representing the bitmap pixels are packed in rows. The size of each row 
is rounded up to a multiple of 4 bytes (32 bits). The pixel array describes the 
image pixel by pixel. You can also have an alpha-channel to add transparency in 
the image using 32-bit color depth.

The coordinates of a Form start from the top-left corner much like most graphic
system out there (why ? Because Western language are mostly written left to right,
top to bottom, and initial text display follow this convention, instead of
classic cartesian coordinate). Forms are indexed starting at 0 instead of 1; 
thus, the top-left pixel of a Form has coordinates 0@0.

The actual bits are held in a Bitmap, whose internal structure is different at 
each depth. 

# Example
To construct an image, we need to know how many bits or byte an individual pixel 
contains in the Pixel Data. 

## Normal mouse cursor:
## 1 bit depth

you can define the color of 32 pixel with color depth 1
playing with color and form.
```smalltalk
(Form extent: 32@2 "size of the form"
 depth: 1 "color depth")
 initFromArray: #( "pixel color, expressed on 4 bytes"
		2r10011000000100010000000000000001
		2r11000000000000000000000000000000
) 
; magnifyBy: 10.
```

Using Bitmap:

```smalltalk
bitMap := Bitmap newFrom: #( "pixel color, expressed on 4 byte"
		2r10011000000100010000000000000001
		2r11000000000000000000000000000000
) .

(Form extent: 32@2 "size of the form"
 depth: 1 "color depth")
 initFromArray: bitMap
; magnifyBy: 10.
```

```smalltalk
(Form extent: 32@2 "size of the form"
 depth: 1 "color depth - 16 => 2 bits to define color value")
 initFromArray: #( 
 2r10101010101010101010101010101010
 2r01010101010101010101010101010101 "2 colors"
) 
; magnifyBy: 25.
```


This is how the normal cursor is defined. By default, a cursor size can only
be 16@16. However, because data is stored on 32 bits, we need to add 16 
additional bit as white to store it, even if they wont be displayed.

```smalltalk
(Form extent: 16@16
	depth: 1
	fromArray: #(
		2r10000001000000000000000000000000
		2r11000000000000000000000000000000

		2r00000011000000000000000000000000) 
	offset: 0@0) magnifyBy: 10.
```

## 2 bits depth

```smalltalk
(Form extent: 16@1 "size of the form"
 depth: 2 "color depth - 16 => 2 bits to define color value")
 initFromArray: #( "pixel color, expressed on 4 bytes or 32 bits, which is the maximum of color depth"

 2r00011011000110110001101100011011 "4 colors"
) 
; magnifyBy: 25.
```


## 4 bits depth

you can define the color of 8 pixel with color depth 16
```smalltalk
(Form extent: 8@2 "size of the form"

array of color using bitmap

```smalltalk
	| bitmap array |
	array := ByteArray new: 256.
	16r0 to: 16rff do: [ :i | array at: i + 1 put: i ].
	array := (array groupsOf: 4) collect: [ :each | each asInteger ].

same code, but this time without using an intermediary bitmap
```smalltalk

## 16 bit depth
"you can define the color of 2 pixel with color depth 16"

```smalltalk

## 32 bits depths

For 32 bits RBG, there is 8 bits allocated to each color component. In
32 bits, there is an additional alpha channel, to manage transparency. 


```smalltalk
(Form extent: 7@1 "size of the form"
 depth: 32 "color depth")
 initFromArray: #( "pixel color, expressed on 4 bytes or 32 bits, which is the maximum of color depth"
"colore are:
2r 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 
     ALPHA    RED 		BLUE     GREEN   "
		16rffff0000 "red"
		16rff0000ff "blue"
		16rff00ff00 "green"
		16rff000000 "black"
		16rffffffff "white"
		16rf0ff00d9 "pink"
		16r2fff0000 "red with opacity"
) 
; magnifyBy: 15.
```



Data is stored in Byte - remember than 8 bit = 1 bytes
Each entry of the color palette takes 4 bytes to define a color

```smalltalk

 initFromArray: #( "pixel color, expressed on 4 bytes or 32 bits, which is the maximum of color depth"
"colore are:
