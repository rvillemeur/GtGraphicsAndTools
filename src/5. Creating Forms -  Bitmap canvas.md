# drawing with canvas

One can manage the Form pixel by pixel. However, you would quickly start to implement
primitive to help drawing line, circles, elipses, border, and fill the geometric 
mesh you would have just created.

Don't look any further, the problem has already been solved, with the Canvas object.
In Pharo, it's more specifically a FormCanvas object, a Canvas that interact well 
with a Form

Here is the definition of Canvas from Pharo documentation:
"A canvas is a two-dimensional medium on which morphs are drawn in a device-independent manner. Canvases keep track of the origin and clipping rectangle, as well as the underlying drawing medium (such as a window, pixmap, or postscript script)."

## creating canvas

```smalltalk
canvas := FormCanvas extent: 10@10.

canvas fillColor: Color white.
canvas line: 0@0 to: 10@10 width: 1 color: Color black.
canvas line: 0@9 to: 9@0 width: 1 color: Color red.
canvas form magnifyBy: 10
```

## canvas with specific depth

```smalltalk
canvas := FormCanvas extent: 10@10 depth: 4.

canvas fillColor: Color white.
canvas line: 0@0 to: 10@10 width: 1 color: Color black.
canvas line: 0@9 to: 9@0 width: 1 color: (Color r: 0.5 g: 0.5 b: 0.5).
canvas form magnifyBy: 10
```

pict := ColorForm extent: 10@10 depth: 2.

"create a color map of 2^depth color"
map := {  Color lightBlue . 
			Color blue .
			Color lightGray .
			Color red.
 }.
pict colors: map.


canvas := FormCanvas on: pict.

"canvas fillColor: (Color fromHexString:'100000')."
canvas line: 0@0 to: 10@10 width: 1 color: Color lightCyan .
canvas line: 0@9 to: 9@0 width: 1 color: Color blue.
canvas line: 0@5 to: 10@5 width: 1 color: Color white.
canvas line: 5@0 to: 5@10 width: 1 color: Color yellow.
canvas line: 0@9 to: 9@0 width: 1 color: Color red.
canvas form 


bitPatternForDepth: depth 
	"Return a Bitmap, possibly containing a stipple pattern, that best represents this color at the given depth. BitBlt calls this method to convert colors into Bitmaps. The resulting Bitmap may be multiple words to represent a stipple pattern of several lines.  "
	"See also:	pixelValueAtDepth:	-- value for single pixel
				pixelWordAtDepth:	-- a 32-bit word filled with the pixel value"
	"Details: The pattern for the most recently requested depth is cached."
	"Note for depths > 2, there are stippled and non-stippled versions (generated with #balancedPatternForDepth: and #bitPatternForDepth:, respectively). The stippled versions don't work with the window bit caching of StandardSystemView, so we make sure that for these depths, only unstippled patterns are returned"
