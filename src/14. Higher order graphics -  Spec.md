# Note on spec2

## architecture
Spec2 is an MVP framework (Model-View-Presenter)

1. The model represent the domain logic of the application
2. The presenter let the developer do the UI programmaticaly
3. The UI is then managed by Pharo.

| passive view (backend morphic, gtk)           | Managed by Pharo through Spec
| your code shouldn't directly interact with it |

                        |

| presenter (your pharo spec code)              | You're responsible of this part
| Subclass of SpPresenter                       |

### SpApplication & SpNotification
SpApplication concentrate ressource for user application like
* which backend to use (Gtk, default is Morphic)
* which style to apply.



### SpPresenter
Your presenter should be a subclass of SpPresenter
SpPresenter subclass: #MyApplicationUI
It must implement:
- initializePresenters => declare the list of widget that compose the GUI

It shoud implement:
- connectPresenters => declare the interaction between the widget
- initializeWindow: for classic windows (method found in SpWindowPresenter)
- initializeDialogWindow: for dialog and modal windows (method found in 
SpDialogWindowPresenter and SpModalWindowPresenter)
=> those method set the title, size, about box, etc... of the window of the UI.





## ObservableSlot
SpObservableSlot is used in variable declaration using slot, to define variable
that could change and could be observable. Look for example at the definition of
class SpPresenter
