### How to find the relationship between Morphic and Spec component
Each component is a presenter, which basic class is 'SpPresenter'
The list of widget available are available in the package 'Spec2-Core-Widgets'
and its sub-package. Their morphic counterpart are in the package 
'Spec2-Adapters-Morphic-Backend'

Ex: for a button. 
```smalltalk
SpButtonPresenter class >> adapterName
^ #ButtonAdapter
```
	
```smalltalk
SpAbstractWidgetPresenter class >> defaultSpec
<spec: #default>
^ SpAbstractWidgetLayout for: self adapterName
```

```smalltalk
SpAdapterBindings subclass: #SpMorphicAdapterBindings	
SpMorphicAdapterBindings >> abstractAdapterClass
	^ SpAbstractMorphicAdapter
```

To link the name:
```smalltalk
 SpAbstractMorphicAdapter  class >> adaptingName
	^ (self name withoutPrefix: 'SpMorphic') asSymbol
```
